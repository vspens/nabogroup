IV. Key Examples of How Matching Works In Real Life
1. Vendor Work Order to Invoice to Payment
•	Vendor performs service (Maintenance Module).
•	Invoice generated and matched to Work Order ID (AP Module).
•	COI check at payment (Compliance Module).
•	Payment posted (Accounting Module).
2. Insurance Renewal
•	Master Insurance Policy expiration triggers alert (Insurance Module).
•	Payment for renewal posted to AP (Accounting Module).
•	Updated certificate stored (Compliance Module).
•	Reserve cash position checked to cover payment (Board Reporting).
3. Management Company Change Post-Acquisition
•	New Management Certificate filing triggered (Compliance Module).
•	Registered Agent updated (Compliance Module).
•	Vendor payment approvals rerouted to new management (Accounting Module).
4. Owner Sells Unit
•	Unit Ledger pulls final balance (Accounting Module).
•	Architectural Approvals verified (Compliance Module).
•	Resale disclosure auto-generated (Resale Module).
•	Move-out fees billed automatically (Accounting/Resale).

VI. Architecture Design Recommendation (for Dev Team)
•	PostgreSQL database recommended (strong relational cross-linking needed).
•	AI/ML Layer ties into meta-triggers ("If X happens in Compliance, launch Y in Accounting").
•	API-driven Connectors to:
o	CINC
o	Vantaca
o	Stripe/QuickBooks
o	Utility Vendors
o	Resale Platforms (HomewiseDocs, etc.)
•	UI/UX
o	Dashboard per Community ID (with drill-downs to modules).
o	Flag Center (show all critical upcoming compliance/accounting events).
o	Full Audit Trail (who approved, posted, corrected, edited, etc.)
